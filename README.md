  <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Carlos' Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  I started learning about Programming in my senior year of High School, and was eager to learn more about it, so I applied for University with Computer Science as my Major, so far I have faced many hardships in this journey but so far I don't have any regrets. I am going to do my very best to have fun, and learn more about Programming.
